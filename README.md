# my-portfolio

Hey ! Welcome to my portfolio!

This was super challenging but I wanted to make the portfolio as personalized as possible and I will update the design of it as we progress through the course.

The header has a background image of a picture I took at Joshua Tree and a photo of me and my dog Pico. Each button in the navbar works accordingly but isn't obvious since my webpage doesn't have that much content. If you scroll down and hit "Welcome" it will take you back to the top of the page.

I have 9 placeholders and one link to Run-Buddy. I decided to make each link a uniform icon to fit an aesthetic. Whatever aesthic I'm going for.. I'm not even sure yet. Also, each link does a little dance of kind of like taking a step back or whatever when you hover over them.

For fun and content, I added a little blog of my thoughts about coding and what I'm learning. Kind of like reactions so the viewer can see how I'm progressing in a personal note I guess. Not sure if I'll keep it in there but it's fun for now.

Finally, the footer has 4 links; Angellist, Github, Linkedin and one to email me directly. I also got these little incons from a website and changed up the color, size, etc. Each link takes a step forward when you hover over them.

I'd say the most challeging part of this challenge was setting up media queries because it wasn't until just a few hours ago that I had to set the meta in the HTML to be ... and finally the px started to respond. Before, anything after max-width 980px, just wasn't showing up at all and the webpage was no longer responding to my changes. It would however, respond to min-widths.. not sure why but it was unhelpful and infuriating.

So, if you play around with the responsiveness on chromedev, I think it's pretty good now but if I were to access my portfolio on my phone right now, it still does not show my updated css. I don't know why, but if you know pls comment the answer lol.

Thanks for taking the time to look around! I appreciate the feedback.
